Coding Guideline for PHP
========================

What does it do?
----------------

The goal of this package is to provide our PHP cgl rules, which are based on PSR-2, via composer.
The package uses PHP_CodeSniffer to sniff the configured PHP files and show errors.

Current state
-------------

This is the initial version of this ruleset. We are currently only using the PSR-2 rules.
Custom rules and sniffs will follow when needed.

This is a early version. More information can be taken from Github at
`current issues`_.
